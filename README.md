# Solar-Optic Portfolio Project

## NEXT/Typescript/Tailwind

This project was intended to be a form of resume for who I am and what I'm doing in web development. It contains a hub for my main projects, a section explaining services I offer and ways to connect with me. Secondarily, I used this opportunity to experiment with more advanced CSS and animations.

Additionally, this project allowed me to get more experience with Nextjs and Tailwind:

- Simple interface for the importance of function

- 3js animations (3d planet orbiting)

- Space aesthetic: I wanted it to be simple but revealing capabilities of much more

- a little fun with parallax on scroll (astronaut)

## Networking

I really wanted this to give me the maximum return on networking.

I also look forward to taking suggestions from users, adding features, and taking feedback.

## To run on your own machine:

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn): Ensure you have Node.js and either npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn installed on your system. You can download them from the official websites:
Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
npm (included with Node.js installation)
yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/
Git version control (optional): While not strictly necessary, having Git installed allows you to clone the project from GitHub and manage your local copy. You can download it from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Steps:

Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal window.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

Use the git clone command followed by the URL of your GitHub repository. For example:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repo-name with the actual name of your repository.

Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned project directory using cd your-repo-name.

Install the project's dependencies using either npm install or yarn install:

Bash

`npm install # or yarn install`

This command will download all the necessary packages listed in your project's package.json file.

Start the Development Server (Optional):

If your project has a development server script defined in package.json (usually named start), you can run it to launch the application locally:

Bash

`npm start  # or yarn start`

This will typically start a development server that allows you to see the application running in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000 or a similar address).

Additional Notes:

Fork the Repository: Instead of cloning, you can fork the repository on GitHub to create your own copy. This allows you to make changes and contribute back to the original project.
Pull Updates: Periodically pull updates from the original repository to keep your local copy in sync with the latest changes.
